I got bored in one of my classes and ended up with a fun idea.
I bought indianatech.org from google domains and 100 ducks on amazon and stuck qr codes on the bottom of them to track their names and how many times they've been found.
I then got some friends to hide these ducks across campus.
now if you go to http://duck.indianatech.org it shows how many ducks have been found.
